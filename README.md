# SO_LONG

This project is all about graphics, using the `MiniLibx`.

It took me almost 2 and a half weeks to finish this project, and I didn't even do all the bonuses!

Apart from that, I'm quite happy about the result.

To run the program, just type `make` and then `./so_long maps/any_map_you_want`

Final grade: 114/100
